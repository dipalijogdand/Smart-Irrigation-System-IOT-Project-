# Smart-Irrigation-System-IOT-Project-

## Description
A Smart Irrigation System using IoT devices to monitor soil moisture, automate watering, and optimize water usage for agriculture. The system provides real-time data monitoring for efficient farm management and helps conserve water resources.

## Features
- Real-time soil moisture monitoring
- Automated irrigation based on sensor data
- Water usage optimization
- Alerts/notifications for low/high moisture levels
- Dashboard for monitoring (optional)

## Components Used
- Soil Moisture Sensor
- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi)
- Water Pump / Solenoid Valve
- IoT Module (e.g., Wi-Fi or Bluetooth)
- Power supply and connecting components

## How It Works
1. The soil moisture sensor reads the moisture level of the soil.
2. Data is sent to the microcontroller.
3. The system decides whether to turn on the water pump.
4. Watering is automated based on preset thresholds.
5. Real-time data can be monitored via a dashboard or mobile app.

## Installation / Setup
1. Connect the soil moisture sensor to the microcontroller.
2. Connect the water pump to the microcontroller via a relay module.
3. Upload the IoT code to the microcontroller.
4. Ensure Wi-Fi/Bluetooth connectivity for real-time monitoring.
5. Test the system with different soil moisture levels.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate weather forecast data for smarter watering
- Mobile app for remote monitoring and control
- Energy-efficient power solutions (solar-powered system)
